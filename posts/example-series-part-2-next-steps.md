# Example Series — Part 2: Next Steps

This is the second part of the Example Series. It continues from the introduction and shows more detail.

## Recap

We introduced the series and explained the frontmatter keys.

## Next steps

1. Add more posts to the series with increasing `series_index`.
2. Optionally add `series_description` in a dedicated place if you want a longer description.

### Deeper dive

You can also add images and extra metadata in frontmatter; the site will display the series badge on each post and list posts on the series page.

## Finished

That's it for the example series — two small posts to demonstrate how it works.
