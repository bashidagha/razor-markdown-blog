# Welcome to My Markdown Blog

This is the first post on my new blog built with ASP.NET Core and Markdig!

## What is this blog?

This blog demonstrates how to create a static site generator using:

-   **ASP.NET Core Razor Pages** for the web framework
-   **Markdig** for markdown processing
-   **Build-time conversion** for performance

## Features

Here are some of the features this blog supports:

### Code Highlighting

```csharp
using System;

namespace MyMarkdownBlog
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

### Lists and Formatting

-   **Bold text** for emphasis
-   _Italic text_ for highlights
-   `Inline code` for small snippets

### Links and Images
