# Example Series — Part 1: Introduction

Welcome to the Example Series. This short series demonstrates how to group posts into a series and show them on the site.

## Why this series?

We want to show how a series groups content and provides navigation for readers.

## What you'll learn

- How frontmatter `series` and `series_index` are used.
- How posts are ordered within a series.

### Quick start

Create multiple posts with the same `series` name and set `series_index` to control order.

## Notes

This is the first entry. Continue to the next part to see an example of a multi-part post.
